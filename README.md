# phd_thesis
My completed PhD thesis &amp; some relevant files (Mathematica code, LaTeX and figures, etc). 

Note: there seem to be image rendering errors happening on Figs. 4.3, 5.4, and 5.6 for reasons unknown. I'll try and re-compile the document when I have a chance, but unless you're doing an in-depth reading it shouldn't be too problematic.
