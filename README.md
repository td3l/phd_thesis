# phd_thesis
My completed PhD thesis & the LaTeX files for the document. Also included a couple of Mathematica notebooks used for simulating the results of some quantum effects, for those interested. 

Note: there seem to be image rendering errors happening on Figs. 4.3, 5.4, and 5.6 for reasons unknown. I'll try and re-compile the document when I have a chance, but unless you're doing an in-depth reading it shouldn't be too problematic.
